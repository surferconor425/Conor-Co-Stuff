# Setting Up a Build Environment

You do everything normally except you have to create a lib folder and add CoFHLib into the folder. You then have to set it as a library (below links will help you do that). Make sure you set it as a global library or it comes up with weird errors.

Don't have a clue how to setup a Minecraft Forge build enviroment? Pahimar has made a great tutorial on how to do it:

You also need to make the folder libs in the main directory (which has README.md in) and download http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/220333-cofhlib/files/2236776 into that directory and rename the file downloaded 'CoFHLib.jar' (No ' in name obviously) then it should all work fine.
